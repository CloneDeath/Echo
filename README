This is a basic one direction FTP sync software 
The goal here is to be as simple as possible.
Requires.net 4.0 or Mono


TODO

I have promised scardy bob I would set the client up to loop if needed. I have not yet done this.
It probably should have a log. It does not.


CLIENT SETUP

There are two clients:
	Client.exe - Command line
	ClientWinForms.exe - GUI Based
	
	
The client uses http to read a list of files from a UWE server. It then goes 
through every single file in you ns2 directory and checks it against the UWE
files. It will offer to delete files that don't exist in the build It then 
logs into the s3 server using creditals stored in clientSettings.ini and 
downloads any files that are not matched from the amazon server.




THESE ARE USED BY PT
	s3Secretkey - your amazon secret key (get it from brian)
	s3IdKey 	- you amazon id key (get it from brian)
	s3Bucket 	- ns2build or ns2build-eu 
	HashSever	- The location to check for UWEs hashes
OTHER SETTINGS YOU MIGHT WANT to edit in the ini file
	DeleteWarningLeveL - number of files to delte before warning the user
	RemoveLocalFiles - delete files that do not exist on the server must be "true" to delete files.
	DownloadType -  the server/authentication method to sue for downloads: (s3)
