This is a basic one direction FTP sync software 


The goal here is to be as simple as possible.


Requires.net 4.0 or Mono

SERVER SETUP 

You need to have a standalone ftp and web server running. 
The server executable looks in the same folder it is in for a file called serverSettings.ini.
It then hashes all fiels and publishes the results as json.

The stuff the server cares about in settings ini are:

HashFile - the output file for the hash list.
LocalDirectory - the directroy to scan.
looptime - how long in ms to sleep between scans of the directory

In theory, Local directory is ftp accessable and the Hashfile is web accessable.

The hash file should look something like:
{
"/TuxRine.png":{"hash":"932cd4479a9cc5e70486114909572afa","time":"2013-08-28 02:01:40"},
"__Server":"Tyr",
"__DateGeneratedUTC":"13-09-03-08-33-19"
}

the server will immediately index thje direcoty upon startup. 
It will also check for and use a file called HashCache.json to limit hashing to files with different modified dates.


CLIENT SETUP

The client uses http to read the json file generated by the server, then logs into the FTP server using creditals stored in clientSettings.ini and downloads any files that are not matched.
The command line client is run one and closed

There is a GUI based client as well. it allows editing and saving of settings from a gui. It works very similarly to the server in most aspects

However, it also uses the folling Settings that are not used by the server:

FTPServer - server to use for ftp downloads
HTTPServer - server to use for http downloads
DeleteWarningLeveL - number of files to delte before warning the user
RemoteUSer - the username for the ftp server
RemotePassword - the password for the ftp server
RemoveLocalFiles - delete files that do not exist on the server must be "true" to delete files.
DownloadType -  the server/authentication method to sue for downloads: (s3, http, ftp)

THESE ARE USED BY PT
s3Secretkey -  your amazon secret key
s3IdKey - you amazon id key
s3Bucket - the s3 instance to connect top
DownloadType=s3


TODO

I have promised scardy bob i would set the client up to loop if needed. I have not yet done this.
